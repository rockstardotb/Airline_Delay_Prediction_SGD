# Airline_Delay_Prediction_SGD

This is a self-guided final project for COMP4442 at the University of Denver as part of the MS in Data Science program. My goal is to see if it is possible to predict the time by which an airline is delayed given a number of predictors.

Given the incredibly large size of the dataset, a secondary goal of this project is to validate the use of stoichastic gradient descent in the approximation of the coefficients of a linear regression model.

### Dataset

The data source contains airline departure delay information from the department of transportation from 2008 to 2019 and was compiled into a single dataset on kaggle.com:

### To Run

Use R-Studio
